# OO Project Principle
    
###  Rather loosely coupled project is better than a tightly coupled one. 

Classes or objects which interacts each other should be loosely coupled (know very less about each other).

## Weather Station solution using Observer pattern

We kept taking what changes constantly and separate it (encapsulating) apart...

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Subject <|.. WeatherData
    Subject --> Observer
    
    CurrentConditionalDisplay <|.. Observer
    ForecastDisplay <|.. Observer
    StaticDisplay <|.. Observer

    CurrentConditionalDisplay <|.. DisplayElement
    ForecastDisplay <|.. DisplayElement
    StaticDisplay <|.. DisplayElement
    
    WeatherData <-- CurrentConditionalDisplay
    WeatherData <-- ForecastDisplay
    WeatherData <-- StaticDisplay
    
```

"Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing."
