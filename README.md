# DesignPatternsStudies

On this repository, I will be doing some tests with the code of the book "Head First Design Patterns" 
by Eric Freeman and Elisabeth Robson.

Not 100% of the code is following their examples, and I'll probably take things from other places 
(which I intend to refer), but the most part is coming from this book. I'll write the code in Java as
long as I'm reading each chapter. My intention is only to improve my understanding of the patterns, and
programming skills.

Other authors that I'm basing of:
